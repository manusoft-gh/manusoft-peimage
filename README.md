# manusoft-peimage
These standalone PE image classes and utilities are extracted without any
modification from the larger WinPatch collection at:
https://github.com/manusoft-gh/manusoft-winpatch

The main API is the PeImage and related classes from PeImage.h. These are
supplemented by the utility functions in PeUtility.h. The classes and helper
functions make it easy to access and work with the tables and other data
structures in PE files (i.e. DLLs and EXEs) from C++ code on Windows. Sorry,
there is no documentation.
